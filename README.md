## What is it?

Green Grass Bot notifies you about music concerts. It searches for musical events  
according to the artists you've been listening to lately. ðŸŽ¶

The project gives listeners the freedom to know about musical events, regardless of the  
artists' advertising budgets. ðŸ†“

Project gives artists the freedom to spread the news about their concerts, no matter  
what kind of advertisements their listeners watch.    ðŸŽ¸

What matters is what kind of music you listen to. Join

## General info

As of the end of 2023, the project is actively developing with single contributor.  

The ultimate project goal is **to create an independent information "hub"** that  
collects information about concerts from as many sources as possible, and also collects  
user listening sessions (scrobbles) directly from music services.  

At the moment, both concerts and scrobbles are **obtained with Last.fm**, and concerts  
using html parsing, what is disadvantage now.

What GreenGrass Bot does in version 0.2-beta:

- Easy adds/removes Last.fm accounts on the `/connect`, `/disconnect` commands
- Monitors unlimited number of Last.fm accounts for each user (current deployment 3 max)
- Checks new concerts on request with `/getgigs` command
- Shows the date and place of concerts with one tap
- Automatically checks new scrobbles and new concerts daily
- Deletes all user data with a single `/delete` command

## Feedback

If you have any opinion about Green Grass Bot, I will appreciate if you send me any  
feedback on [my Telegram] â€” even two words will be helpful. Also you can [file an  
issue].  
Feature requests are welcome too.

## Setup 
You can setup you own concert notificator in five minutes. The bare minimum that needs  
to be done is for you to replace the `API_KEY` and `BOT_TOKEN` in `.env-example` and  
rename in to `.env`. [Telegram] and [Last.fm API] accounts are required. Commands below  
works for Linux; may be for Mac too.

1) Clone the project:
    ```
    $ cd /project_folder/
    $ git clone https://github.com/baidakovil/Green-Grass-Bot .
    ```

2) Open [BotFather], create telegram bot with `/newbot`. Pass provided **Bot Token** to  
    `.env` file using provided `.env-example` file

3) Same, insert **API Key** provided by Last.fm to `.env`

4) (Optional, recommended) Create dedicated virtual environment to use the bot and  
    activate it. I use *virtualenv*, some *venv*. Path and name are to your discretion. 
    ```
    $ cd /virtual_environments_folder/
    $ virtualenv env_name
    $ source env_name/bin/activate
    ```

5) With virtual env activated, `cd` into project folder and install dependencies:
    ```
    $ cd /project_folder/
    $ python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
    ```

6) Finally, execute the following command to launch your bot:
    ```
    $ python3 main.py
    ```

## Deployment

#### Docker
Docker is simplest approach for deployment. If you are unfamiliar with docker, it is  
recommended you go through a quick tutorial for it first.

1) Create a *.env* file using [*.env-example*] and update **BOT_TOKEN** and **API_KEY** 
2) If you using the project as it is (**no intended code changes**), then simply run  
 `./scripts/deploy_docker.sh` and your deployment will be automatically done. 
 
3) If you made code changes, you should build docker image again. Refer to  Docker  
 tutorial [Update the application] section, your commands will looks like:
    ```
    $ cd /project_folder/
    $ docker build -t ggb .
    $ docker run -d --name green-grass-bot --env-file ../.env --restart=always ggb
    ```
`green-grass-bot`, `ggb`, up to your discretion.  
Notice: *.env* file we configured in **(1)** is being passed via the `--env-file` argument. 

#### Manual
Alternatively, if you are unfamiliar with docker or would like a more manual approach,  
you may also setup the bot 24/7. Two main approaches is:
* **systemd (systemctl)** Linux system, the way I do prefer. You will need to store provided file  
`greengrassbot.service` on your system in `/lib/systemd/system/`. You can use example in  
`scripts` folder.  
Note:  
to use `.github/deployment.yml` workflow for automatic deploy you'll need to set system rule  
for executing `sudo systemctl restart greengrassbot.service` command without password.  
[askUbuntu] on this topic.
* **screen** utility on Linux systems. For example, you can follow the [tjtanjin's guide].

## Contributing
If you wish to make code contributions to the project, you are welcome. What it need at  
most â€” professional **review** and **vectors of evolution**.

## Program name

**Green Grass** refers to *High Hopes* popular *Pink Floyd*'s song. To be honest I do not like it much.
