But how does the bot know what music I listen to?*\nThe bot uses the Last\\.fm service\\. You need to register on it and connect your player to your Lastfm\\-account\\. Almost all music services and players in the world are supported: Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube\\.\\.\\.\n\n*What does it look like?*\nLet's say you listened to Frank Sinatra, Madonna and Pink Floyd recently\\. Coincidentally, last two are on tour now and giving concerts\\. The bot will send you a message:\n ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n *New Events*\n for _music\\_lover\\_99_\n /01 Madonna\n /02 Pink Floyd\n ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nOn /01 and /02 you will learn more about the concerts\\. If there are no new concerts, the bot will not send anything\n\n*What functions and settings does the bot have?*\nThe bot is simple one\\. So what you can see in *Preferences* in command list on /start is really all it have\n\n*So, on Lastfm everyone can see what I listened to and when? *\nYes\\. For now, only public Lastfm\\-accounts are supported\\.\nIt's great: millions of Lastfm\\-users share their auditions with friends and other people\\. Join\\!\n\n*I listen to online\\ radio, so there are a lot of artists I don't know\\. I don't want to see notifications about their concerts\\. Is it possible to cut off rare artists?*\nFor now, all listened artists are checked\\. A filter based on the number of plays will appear very soon\n\n*I want to see notifications only about concerts in my city\\. Can we set this up?*\nAs soon as we implement the function above, we'll do this üòå\n\n*How does the bot obtain information about concerts?*\nAlso with Lastfm\n\n*Do I have to pay something?*\nNo: neither for Lastfm, nor for bot\n\n*What about advertising, personal data? I practice cyber hygiene\\!*\nüëç \\! The bot never sends advertisements: this is [OpenSource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) project\\. The program code is in open access on [GitHub](https://github.com/baidakovil/GreatGigBot)\\. Personal data is not collected for ‚Äúfeature improvement‚Äù\\. Complete data removal provided by the command /delete\n\n*What else?*\nYou can add several Lastfm\\-accounts\\. Connect your friend's Lastfm\\-account and give him a ticket to the concert as a gift\n\n*?*\nü§ü\n\n*I have questions and comments about the bot\\. And ideas on new functions\\. Whom should I ask?*\nAlways welcome\\! Write to: baidakovil@gmail\\.com or to GitHub\n\n*So, what to do?*\nIf the Lastfm\\-account is already there, click /connect\\. If not, follow the short instruction placed at /start",
